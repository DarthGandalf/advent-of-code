# AOC 2021 (aoc2021)

This was supposed to be available in web, but I didn't make the UI nice, and for latest days I didn't even add them to the list of days.

For days up to 22, they can be run via `npm run test:unit:ci`

Day 23 was done on paper (or, rather, in `kwrite`).

Day 24 I converted the input to C++, and brute forced it. Maybe I should have considered parallelizing it, or to actually figure out what it's doing, but the ETA to finish running it was mid Jan, which I deemed fast enough to avoid bothering with a better solution, and that's exactly when it finished and when I got the last star.

For day 25, run `npx ts-node run25.ts`, because by that time I got fed up with jest randomly hiding the errors, making it impossible to debug.

But if you really wish to see the not-finished web UI, read on. Here's the rest of boilerplate README generated by Quasar.

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

### Lint the files

```

### Build the app for production
