# My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2023 in Raku.

(Spaghetti code with Ragu sauce)

I'm doing [Allez

## Accessibility

The code is more or less readable. The especially unreadable ones (which are shaped as an ASCII art) have a parent commit where the same file was more readable

However, I'm only learning Raku, so the code quality is far from perfect,
therefore it's "spaghetti".
