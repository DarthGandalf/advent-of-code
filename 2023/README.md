# Spaghetti code with Ragu sauce

My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2023 in Raku.

I'm doing [Allez
Cuisine](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1883kn1/advent_of_code_2023_allez_cuisine_submissions/)
challenge every day, here are the special ingredients used for every day.

Note: I've intentionally misread some of the prompts to deliver not quite what was asked for :)

## Accessibility

The code is more or less readable. The especially unreadable ones (which are shaped as an ASCII art) have a parent commit where the same file was more readable

However, I'm only learning Raku, so the code quality is far from perfect,
therefore it's "spaghetti".
